## Welcome to my Learning Outcomes Repo and Directory

This is where I will organize all the L.O. information and code I come across in the next year or so. The goal here is to 
- Find all relevant documentation, and bring the *most useful* to the top
- Find all relevant open source code, and determine what's missing.
- Write and distribute the missing code. 

## High Level Intro to Learning Outcomes

It is a data-collection requirement from the (Federal) Department of Education, the State (California) and the regional accrediting body (ACCJC). The reqirements and goals and definitions are frustratingly vague. This site and code is intended to clarify some of that.
